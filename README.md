# SuperDuperGame
A very simple 2D super-duper game made with [ebitengine](https://ebitengine.org/)
## How does the game work?
The game is very simple. You can move the yellow character (you / the player) with WASD or the arrows.
The goal is to collect / collide with 20 red characters (the enemies). Each enemy disappears 2 seconds after it spawns, so you have to be quick.
If you lose or win you can restart the game by pressing `SPACE` on your keyboard.
